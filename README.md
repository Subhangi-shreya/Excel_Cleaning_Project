# Excel Data Cleaning Project (Power Query)

This project demonstrates how to clean and transform raw datasets using **Power Query in Excel**.  
It covers the complete process of handling missing values, removing duplicates, correcting data formats, and preparing a structured dataset ready for analysis.

## Project Structure

- **Cleaned_Data/** → Contains the final cleaned dataset.  
- **Raw_Sales_Dataset/** → Contains the raw dataset(s) before cleaning (zipped folder).

## Tools & Techniques Used

- **Microsoft Excel (Power Query)**  
 
- Removed duplicate entries to prevent redundancy.  
- Addressed missing or null values—either by filling in default values, removing non-critical incomplete entries, or flagging critical missing fields.  
- Converted columns to appropriate data types: dates, numbers, text etc.  
- Standardized column naming—consistent casing, removal of extraneous characters.  
- Reformatted date fields to a uniform format .  
- Merged and split fields where necessary (e.g. splitting full names, combining address components).  
- Created calculated fields (e.g. Total_sales = Quantity ×  Price).  
- Filtered out outliers or erroneous records based on business logic

## Process Overview

1. Import raw data into Power Query.  
2. Apply transformations (remove nulls, duplicates, etc.).  
3. Standardize columns (text case, date formats).  
4. Generate a final clean and structured dataset.  
5. Load the cleaned data back into Excel.

## Results

- The dataset is cleaned and well-structured.  
- All duplicates, missing values, and formatting issues have been resolved.  
- Final cleaned dataset is available in the project folder.  

---

## Use Case

Cleaned and structured data is now ready for:
- Sales/Business Analysis  
- Dashboard Creation (Excel, Power BI, Tableau)  
- Further Data Processing (Python, SQL, etc.)
